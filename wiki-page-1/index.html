            Crown shyness (also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup> canopy shyness,[2] or 
            inter-crown spacing[3]) is a feature observed in some tree species, 
            in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, 
            instead forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5] This is most 
            prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between 
            trees of different species.[6][7] There exist many hypotheses as to
             why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests 
             that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]
