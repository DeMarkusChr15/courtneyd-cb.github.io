     <h2> Graphic Design </h2> 

     <hr>
     
     <p>
            <b>Graphic design</b> is a <i>profession<sup>[2]</sup>,academic 
            discipline<sup>[3][4][5]</sup></i>and <i>applied art</i>  
            whose activity consists in projecting <i>visual 
            communications</i> intended to transmit specific messages to social 
            groups, with specific objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an 
            interdisciplinary branch of <i>design</i><sup>[1]</sup> and of the 
            <i>fine arts</i>. Its practice involves <i>creativity, innovation
            </i> and <i>lateral thinking</i> using manual or <i>digital tools
            </i>, where it is usual to use text and <i>graphics</i> to 
            communicate visually.

         <p>Due to its interdisciplinary nature, graphic design can be performed in 
     different areas of application: branding, technical and artistic drawing, 
     signage, photography, image and video editing, 3D modeling, animation, 
     programming, among other fields. <sup>[1]</sup>
         </p>
     <p>
         The role of the <i>graphic designer</i> in the communication process 
         is that 
         of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
         interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually,
          graphic design uses the <i>aesthetics</i> of <i>typography</i> and the
           compositional
           arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, 
           feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The 
           design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends 
           up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, 
           that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a 
           graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>


     </p>
     <p>
         Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of
         knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it 
         can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in
          the <i>aviation</i> world<sup>[8]</sup> or space exploration
          <sup>[9][10]</sup>. In this 
          sense, in 
          some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the 
          production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
          communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes 
          where it can be applied.
     </p>
     <p>
         With origins in <i>Antiquity</i> and the <i>Middle Ages</i>
         <sup>[11]</sup>, graphic design as 
         applied art was initially linked to the boom of <i>rise of printing</i>
          in
         Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the 
         <i>Industrial Revolution</i>. From there it emerged as a distinct
          profession 
         in the West, closely associated with <i>advertising</i> in the 19th 
         century.<sup>[12]</sup>
          and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. 
          Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the 
          demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly 
          because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay 
          attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who 
          develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>

                <hr>

     <p>
        William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the term 
        "graphic design" in a 1922 article,<sup>[14]</sup> although it appears 
        in a 4 July 
        1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of <i>Organized Labor</i>, a 
        publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about 
        technical education for printers:
     </p>
     <p>
         An Enterprising Trades Union
     </p>
            <p>
                … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails 
                among 
            printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of 
            design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and 
            develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
     </p>
     <p>
        A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the 
        <i>California School of
         Arts & Crafts</i> advertised a course titled Graphic Design and 
         Lettering, 
         which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes 
         were taught by Frederick Meyer.<sup>[16]</sup>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Main article: <i>History of graphic design</i></p>
        
         In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of 
         visual <i>communication</i> in the 20th and 21st centuries, the 
         distinction 
         between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. 
         They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, 
         <i>languages</i> 
         and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the 
         ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design
         ,"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, 
         expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human 
         experience."<sup>[17]</sup>
     </p>
     <p>
         The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively recent 
         concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. Although there is
          no consensus on an exact date when graphic design emerged, some date 
          it back to the <i>Interwar period</i>. Others understand that it began
           to be 
          identified as such by the late 19th century.<sup>[11]</sup>
     </p>
     <p> 
         It can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes 
         have their origins in <i>Paleolithic cave paintings</i> and the birth 
         of 
         written language in the third millennium BCE. However, the differences
          in working methods, auxiliary sciences, and required training are such
           that it is not possible to clearly identify the current graphic 
           designer with prehistoric man, the 15th-century <i>xylographer</i>, 
           or the 
           <i>lithographer</i> of 1890.
     </p>
     <p>
        The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic 
        manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
        recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an 
        industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been 
        "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, ergonomic, 
        contextual, among others.
     </p>
     Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and profession 
     has been closely linked to technological innovations, social needs, and the
      visual imagination of professionals.<sup>[18]</sup> Graphic design has 
      been practiced
       in various forms throughout history; in fact, good examples of graphic 
       design date back to manuscripts from ancient <i>China, Egypt,</i> and 
       <i>Greece</i>. 
       As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, advances 
       in graphic design continued over the subsequent centuries, with composers
        or typographers often designing pages according to established type.
        <sup>[11]</sup>
        <p>
             By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct 
             profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor 
             specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new 
             technologies and business possibilities brought about by the 
             Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation
             of the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from its
              actual production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early 
              20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and 
              magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements 
              of communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole, 
              creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922, 
              typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to 
              identify the emerging field.<sup>[11]</sup>

               In China, during the <i>Tang dynasty</i> (618–907) wood blocks 
               were cut 
               to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A 
               Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed 
               book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and 
               books were produced using <i>movable type</i> printing, making 
               books widely available during the <i>Song dynasty</i> (960–1279).
               <sup>[19]</sup>

               In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, 
               <i>Johannes Gutenberg</i> 
               developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace using
                movable type made with a new metal alloy<sup>[20]</sup> that 
                created a 
                revolution in the dissemination of information.<sup>[21]</sup>

                <h3>Nineteenth century</h3>

               In 1849, <i>Henry Cole</i> became one of the major forces in 
               <i>design 
               education</i> in Great Britain, informing the government of the 
               importance of design in his <i>Journal of Design</i> and 
               <i>Manufactures</i>. 
               He organized the <i>Great Exhibition</i> as a celebration of 
               modern industrial technology and Victorian design.

               From 1891 to 1896, <i>William Morris' Kelmscott Press</i> was a 
               leader in graphic design associated with the <i>Arts and Crafts 
                movement</i>, 
               creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,
               <sup>[22]</sup> in addition to wallpaper and textile designs.
               <sup>[23]</sup> Morris' 
               work, along with the rest of the <i>Private Press</i> movement, 
               directly
               influenced <i>Art Nouveau</i>.<sup>[24]</sup>

               <p>
                <i>Will H. Bradley</i> became one of the notable graphic 
                designers in 
               the late nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in various
                Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs as
                promotions for a literary magazine titled <i>The Chap-Book</i>.

                 the 
                 <i>California School of Arts and Crafts</i>, taught a class 
                 entitled 
                 "Graphic Design and Lettering".<sup>[26]</sup> Raffe's 
                 <i>Graphic Design</i>, 
                 published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" 
                 in its title.<sup>[27]</sup> In 1936, author and graphic 
                 designer Leon 
                 Friend published his book titled "Graphic Design" and it is

                    Although he lacked artistic 
                training, <i>Frank Pick</i> led the Underground Group design and 
                publicity movement. The first Underground station signs were 
                introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a 
                blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station 
                name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick 
                used the expertise of <i>Edward Johnston</i> to design a new 
                typeface 
                for the Underground. Johnston redesigned the Underground sign 
                and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center

                    In the 1920s, Soviet <i>constructivism</i> applied 
                    'intellectual production' in different spheres of production
                    . The movement 
                saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and 
                thus moved towards creating objects for <i>utilitarian</i> 
                purposes. 
                They designed buildings, film and theater sets, posters,

                repudiated the

                typographers such as Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and 
                El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. They pioneered

                devices 
                used throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw

                The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with 
                <i>consumerism</i>. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably
                 from 
                within the graphic design community with the 
                <i>First Things First manifesto</i>. First launched by <i>Ken 
                Garland</i> in 1964, it was 
                re-published as the <i>First Things First 2000 manifesto</i>
                 in 1999 in
                 the magazine <i>Emigre</i> 51<sup>[34]</sup> stating 
                 "We propose a reversal of 
                 priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic 
                 forms of communication – a mindshift away from product 
                 marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new
                  kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must 
                  expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be 
                  challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through 
                  the visual languages and resources of design."<sup>[35]</sup>

                    Graphic design can have many applications, from 
                    <i>road signs</i> 
                    to technical schematics and reference <i>manuals</i>. It is 
                    often 
                    used in branding products and elements of company identity 
                    such as logos, colors, <i>packaging, labelling</i> and text.

                    From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation
                     of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and 
                     thoughtful compositions of visual information – known as 
                     <i>information design</i>. With the advent of the web, 
                     information designers with experience in interactive tools 
                     are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news 
                      stories. Information design can include <i>Data and 
                      information visualization</i>, which involves using 
                      programs to interpret and form data into a visually 
                      compelling presentation, and can be tied in with 
                      <i>information graphics</i>.
