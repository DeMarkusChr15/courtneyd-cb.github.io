     <h2> Graphic Design </h2> 
     
     <p>
            <b>Graphic design</b> is a profession,academic discipline
            and applied art  
            whose activity consists in projecting visual 
            communications intended to transmit specific messages to social 
            groups, with specific objectives. Graphic design is an 
            interdisciplinary branch of design and of the fine arts. Its 
            practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using
            manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics 
            to communicate visually.   
     </p>
     <p>
         The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that 
         of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
         interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually,
          graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the compositional
           arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, 
           feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The 
           design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends 
           up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, 
           that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a 
           graphic manifestation.

         Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of
         knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it 
         can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in
          the aviation world or space exploration. In this sense, in 
          some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the 
          production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
          communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes 
          where it can be applied.
     </p>
     <p>
         With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, graphic design as 
         applied art was initially linked to the boom of rise of printing in
         Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the 
         Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct profession 
         in the West, closely associated with advertising in the 19th century
          and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. 
          Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the 
          demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly 
          because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay 
          attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who 
          develop them.

        William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the term 
        "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it appears in a 4 July 
        1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of <i>Organized Labor</i>, a 
        publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about 
        technical education for printers:
     </p>
     <p>
         An Enterprising Trades Union
            … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among 
            printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of 
            design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and 
            develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
     </p>

        A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the California School of
         Arts & Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, 
         which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes 
         were taught by Frederick Meyer.

        Main article: History of graphic design
        
         In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of 
         visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction 
         between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. 
         They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages 
         and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the 
         ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design
         ,"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, 
         expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human 
         experience."
     </p>

         The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively recent 
         concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. Although there is
          no consensus on an exact date when graphic design emerged, some date 
          it back to the Interwar period. Others understand that it began to be 
          identified as such by the late 19th century.<sub>[11]</sub>

         It can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes 
         have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of 
         written language in the third millennium BCE. However, the differences
          in working methods, auxiliary sciences, and required training are such
           that it is not possible to clearly identify the current graphic 
           designer with prehistoric man, the 15th-century xylographer, or the 
           lithographer of 1890.

        The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic 
        manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
        recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an 
        industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been 
        "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, ergonomic, 
        contextual, among others.
     </p>
     Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and profession 
     has been closely linked to technological innovations, social needs, and the
      visual imagination of professionals.[18] Graphic design has been practiced
       in various forms throughout history; in fact, good examples of graphic 
       design date back to manuscripts from ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. 
       As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, advances 
       in graphic design continued over the subsequent centuries, with composers
        or typographers often designing pages according to established type.

             By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct 
             profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor 
             specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new 
             technologies and business possibilities brought about by the 
             Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation
             of the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from its
              actual production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early 
              20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and 
              magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements 
              of communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole, 
              creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922, 
              typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to 
              identify the emerging field.<sub>[11]</sub>
